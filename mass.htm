<b>Mass-communication</b>, as a stream of study, and as a career, becomes so important and enviable.<br>
Mass Communication is not limited to journalism alone. To a great extent mass media is a modern reality which covers all aspects of human life.<br>
<b><u>Step-by-Step</u></b> Not long ago, people with good communication skills and a degree in literature were considered fit for journalism and other areas of mass communication. However, with technology playing greater role in our lives, all professions related to mass communication now require skilled professionals who work fast and efficiently send across the message to a whole range of audience. Even though with the proliferation of blogs, it is commonly claimed that ‘anyone’ can become a journalist, a closer inspection of reality proves that only those with professional training make the grade. <br>
<b><u>Job Prospects</u></b> A professional course in mass communication opens doors for a career in films & TV, publishing, public relations, journalism, editing, direction, filmmaking, scriptwriting, production, etc. In nutshell, Mass Communication widens up the horizon of career options for a person.
