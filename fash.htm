Fashion designing is one of the most lucrative, appealing, glamorous and exciting career options in today's world.

Thus, if you can create magic with colours, shapes and designs, then just obtain a professional course to begin a successful career in the alluring world of fashion designing. <br>
<b><u>Step-by-Step</u></b> To start a career as a fashion designer, two types of qualifications are required, that is, natural and acquired. <br>
<b><u>• Natural:</u></b> this skill set would comprise of a decent aesthetic sense, colour expertise, good taste and sense of trends and fashion. An eye for detail, knowledge of fabrics and so on is a big plus for those serious about a career as a fashion designer<br>. 
• <b><u>Acquired skills</u></b> would be a qualification from a decent, recognized fashion Institute. You can enrol for either a full-time course or a part time certificate course. Students usually take these up after their 10+2 level. Not that the courses are not available for graduates or people with higher qualification. There are several short-term certificate courses that are offered by the same fashion institutes for super specialization, on part-time basis. These courses equip you with technical and creative thinking skills. <br>
While the academic requirements are not very high, you need considerable aptitude and talent to be labelled “designer” material. You must be highly creative to combine colours, shades and textures and express your ideas through sketches. <br>
Your race for admission into a reputed fashion school will begin straight after school. Subjects like drawing, painting, home science and computer graphics will develop your creativity. <br>
By the time you finish the course you will have mastered the step-by-step making of a garment: from designing to pattern making, production and even marketing. <br>
